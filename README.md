# PDF-Merger

This is a PDF Merger using Python which can merge multiple PDf's into a single one.
This PDF Merger uses the PyPDF2 package to work on.
For the PDF's to merge into the single one, initially the PDF's must be in the same folder. 
The merged PDF will be named as "combinedDocs.pdf" or you can just change it in the source code to your desired name.
